=== Note : Still under heavy tests ===

EP4Bookx is a fork of  Easy Populate 4.0 to support Bookx fields.
Based  on Music fields, was adapted to manage bookx

Quick review how to use it:

Install EasyPopulate as you would, and enable Bookx fields support in EP configuration

You can assign a fallback genre, or leave it blank. Possibly other fallback fields, such as authors could be add it, or completely remove this functionality.

If there's empty fields, such as authors, publishers, etc... a report is generated (still working on it ), with a link to edit the book.
I found that there's no need to skip fields, but instead, insert them, and have the possibility to have a more visual way to know witch fields are missing and were
 
EP4Bookx uses status 10 (same a 9 in EP), but  changed to remove bookx fields associated with the products.
So you would do v_status 10, to remove books.

For now, EP4Bookx only supports the default language, and only one Author and  Genre can be assign (it's on @todo list)

/**
 * @todo  export with support for languages
 * @todo  export assinged multiple authors
 * @todo  export assinged multiple genres
